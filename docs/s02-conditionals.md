# Conditionals

## creates
[string] and [array] type

`creates` parameter can have both string and array type e.g.

```yaml
backup-data:
  cmd.run:
  - name: echo 123
  - creates:
    - file1.txt
    - file2.txt

#or
backup-data:
  cmd.run:
  - name: echo 123
  - creates: file1.txt
```
The `creates` parameter identifies the files which should be missing if you want to run the current task. In other words if any of the files in the `creates` section exist, the task will never run.

A typical example use case for this parameter would be an exclusive access to a file, e.g. we don't run the backup, if the file is locked by another process:

```yaml
backup-data:
  cmd.run:
  - names:
    - touch serviceALock.txt
    - tar cvf somedata.txt.tar somedata.txt
    - rm serviceALock.txt
  - creates: serviceALock.txt
```

In this situation we expect that the script is running periodically, so at some point the lock will be removed, and the backup-data script get a chance to make a backup.

## onlyif
[string] and [array] type

The `onlyif` parameter gives a list of commands which will be executed before the actual task and if any of them fails (returns non zero exit code), the task will be skipped. However, the failures won't stop the program execution. The `onlyif` checks are given to prove that the task should run, in case of failure the task will be completely ignored.

In the example below the command `kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my_topic --new-producer < my_file.txt` won't be triggered, if tacoscript detects, that kafka or zookeeper services are not running or `messages.txt` file doesn't exist.

`onlyif` parameter can be both string and array e.g.

```yaml
publish-kafka-message:
  cmd.run:
    - name: kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my_topic --new-producer < my_file.txt
    - onlyif: test -e my_file

#or

publish-kafka-message:
  cmd.run:
    - name: kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my_topic --new-producer < messages.txt
    - onlyif:
        - service kafka status
        - service zookeeper status
        - test -e messages.txt
```

## unless
[string] and [array] type

The `unless` is a reverted `onlyif` parameter which means the task will run only of the `unless` condition fails (returns a non-zero exit code). However if multiple `unless` parameters are used, tacoscript will execute the task only if **one** `unless` condition fails (the `onlyif` parameters should be all successful to unblock the task).

The examples below show some use cases for this parameter.
We execute the command `service myservice start` only if we detect that there are no critical logs. Without this condition tacoscript will try to start the service which has no chance to be started.

```yaml
start-myservice:
  cmd.run:
    - name: service myservice start
    - unless: test -e myservice_fatallogs.txt

#or
```

The second example demonstrates a check for some required configs. If the tacoscript detects any missing config from the list, it will send an email to the server's adminstrator.

```yaml
report-failure:
  cmd.run:
    - name: mail -s "Some configs are missing, check what is going on" admin@admin.com
    - unless:
        - test -e criticalConfigOne.txt
        - test -e criticalConfigTwo.txt
        - test -e criticalConfigThree.txt
```
